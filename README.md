Rational

There are many online resources to help with calculating ballistics for guns and more archaic weapons such as bows, slings, etc. But there are few command line tools. I like command line tools. They don't require a working Internet connection. They can also be piped into a toolchain to help with automating processes. That's often difficult or next to impossible with most online tools.
